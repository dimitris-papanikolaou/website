### 1. Who Bears the Cost of Aggregate Fluctuations and Why?   <span style="font-variant:small-caps;color:Tomato;">(new)</span>
#### (*with [Maarten Meeuwis](https://www.maartenmeeuwis.com/), [Lawrence Schmidt](https://sites.google.com/site/lawrencedwschmidt/home) and [Jonathan Rothbaum](https://sites.google.com/site/jlrothbaum/home?pli=1)*) 

Higher discount rates lead to lower worker earnings for workers at the bottom of the income distribution; these declines are primarily driven by job separations. By contrast, lower cashflow (or productivity) news is followed by declines in earnings for workers in the top of the income distribution, with most of the effect coming from the intensive margin. We build an equilibrium model of labor market search that quantitatively replicates these facts. The model has several implications regarding the role of discount rates in generating unemployment fluctuations; the drivers of the low level of cyclicality of aggregate worker earnings; and the redistributive effects of business cycle fluctuations and monetary policy.

### 2. Intangible Capital, Non-rivalry, and Growth  <span style="font-variant:small-caps;color:Tomato;">(new)</span>
#### (*with [Nicolas Crouzet](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/crouzet/html/index.html), [Janice Eberly](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/eberly_janice_c.aspx), and [Andrea Eisfeldt](http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/x33175.xml)*)

We provide an answer to why growth may slow even in the face of technological improvements. Our focus is on the role of intangible assets. Intangible assets are distinct from physical capital
in that they are comprised by information that requires a storage medium. A reduction in replication costs for intangible assets enables them to be less rivalrous in use, stimulating growth.
However, we show how limits to excludability create a countervailing force that limits growth. This paper subsumes the working paper [A model of intangible capital](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x77j4e67b790l9u/Model_of_Intangible_Capital.pdf?raw=1).

### 3. Technology, Vintage-Specific Human Capital, and Labor Displacement: Evidence from Linking Patents with Occupations  
####   (*with [Leonid Kogan](http://web.mit.edu/lkogan2/www/), [Lawrence Schmidt](https://sites.google.com/site/lawrencedwschmidt/home) and [Bryan Seegmiller](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/phd/students/bryan-seegmiller)*)

 We construct occupation-specific indicators of technological change that span two centuries (1850-2010) using textual analysis of patent documents and occupation task descriptions. We find strong evidence that much of technical change has been displacive of labor during this period. Contrary to the standard SBTC model, high-payed workers experience relatively worse outcomes. We reconcile this fact with the standard model by allowing for skill displacement. Previously titled "Technological Change and Occupations over the Long Run"

### 4. Technological Innovation and Labor Income Risk  
####   (*with [Leonid Kogan](http://web.mit.edu/lkogan2/www/), [Lawrence Schmidt](https://sites.google.com/site/lawrencedwschmidt/home) and Jae Song*)

Using administrative data, we examine how labor income risk depends on innovation shocks.
