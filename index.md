Trust, Collaboration, and Economic Growth (*with [Jiro E. Kondo](http://people.mcgill.ca/jiro.kondo/) and [Danielle Li](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/danielle-li)*)##### *Management Science, forthcoming*We propose a macroeconomic model in which variation in the level of trust leads to higher innovation, investment, and productivity growth. The key feature in the model is a hold-up friction in the creation of new capital. Innovators generate ideas but are inefficient at implementing them into productive capital on their own.  Firms can help innovators implement their ideas efficiently, but cannot ex ante commit to compensating them appropriately. This paper is a significantly revised version of a previous paper titled, ``Cooperation cycles: A theory of endogenous investment-specific shocks.''[[Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zhszlac6a01slac/KPcycles.pdf?raw=1)]### 4.	Left Behind: Creative Destruction, Inequality, and the Stock Market (*with [Leonid Kogan](http://web.mit.edu/lkogan2/www/) and [Noah Stoffman](http://kelley.iu.edu/nstoffma/)*)##### *Journal of Political Economy, 2020, 128(3)*We develop a general equilibrium model of asset prices in which the benefits of technological innovation are distributed asymmetrically. Financial market participants do not capture all the economic rents resulting from innovative activity, even when they own shares in innovating firms. Economic gains from innovation accrue partly to the innovators, who cannot sell claims on the rents their future ideas will generate. The model implies that improvements in technology can lower households' indirect utility. The resulting hedging motives can give rise to a value premium.

Illiquidity risk has a substantially larger effect on utility and portfolio policies than illiquidity that is deterministic. We extend the model to incorporate infrequent illiquidity crisis and characterize the illiquidity risk premium. Illiquidity risk leads to limited arbitrage even in normal times.###### *Winner of the 2011 Roger F Murray Prize (Second Prize), Q Group*[[Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sg6ntkv7emfjp1w/APW-Liquidity.pdf?raw=1)]### 12.	Firm Characteristics and Stock Returns: The Role of Investment-Specific Shocks (*with [Leonid Kogan](http://web.mit.edu/lkogan2/www/))*##### *Review of Financial Studies, 2013, 26(11)*A number of existing cross-sectional anomalies - investment, Q, profitability, idiosyncratic volatility, and market beta share a common explanation. These characteristics are correlated with the share of growth opportunities to firm value and thus with firms' exposures to capital-embodied shocks.[[Paper  (corrects minor errors in published version)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vvmh7sue3lflkl8/FirmCharacteristics.pdf?raw=1)] [[Web Appendix](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jv0cqs6vvl44btn/FirmCharacteristics_APP.pdf?raw=1)]### 13.	Growth Opportunities, Technology Shocks and Asset Prices (*with [Leonid Kogan](http://web.mit.edu/lkogan2/www/))*##### *Journal of Finance, April 2014, 69(2)*Firms' beta with a portfolio of investment minus consumption good producers is correlated with the share of growth opportunities to firm value. Value and growth firms vary in their share of growth opportunities to firm value, and hence in their exposure to capital-embodied shocks. The model generates the value premium, the value factor, and the failure of the CAPM in the data.###### *Winner of the 2014 Amundi Smith Breeden Prize (First Prize)*[[Paper  (corrects minor errors in published version)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k6v9v12gvqvybfh/GrowthOpt.pdf?raw=1)] [[Web Appendix](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bvi6epq0ai4asmq/GrowthOpt_APP.pdf?raw=1)]### 14.

This sharing rule is stochastic, as it depends on the managers' outside option, which itself is a function of the investment opportunities in the economy. From shareholders' perspective, organization capital is exposed to additional risks, hence firms' with more organization capital have higher risk premia.###### *Winner of the 2013 Amundi Smith Breeden Prize (First Prize)*[[Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cgf6io9vmnddw50/OrganizationCapital.pdf?raw=1)][[Web Appendix](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fzbc12udrxa2g2x/OrganizationCapital_APP.pdf?raw=1)][[Replication Kit and Extended Data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ffqfdt8vf9uwsk5/org%20cap%20replication%20and%20data%20update.zip?raw=1)]### 15.
